* spray.el

A speed reading mode for Emacs


** Screencast

The story continues at [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html][gnu.org]]

** Installation

Put spray.el into a "load-path"ed directory, and load it in your init
file.

: (require 'spray)

Then you can start spraying from the cursor position with =M-x
spray-mode=. Binding some keys may also be useful.

: (global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'spray-mode)

** Commands

In spray-mode buffers, following commands are available.

- =spray-start/stop= (SPC) ::
     pause or resume spraying

- =spray-backward-word= (h, <left>) ::
     pause and back to the last word

- =spray-forward-word= (l, <right>) ::
     inverse of =spray-backward-word=

- =spray-faster= (f) ::
     increases speed

- =spray-slower= (s) ::
     decreases speed

- =spray-quit= (q, <return>) ::
     quit =spray-mode=


** Customization

You may customize spray by modifying following items:

- [Variable] spray-wpm
- [Variable] spray-height
- [Variable] spray-margin-top
- [Variable] spray-margin-left
- [Variable] spray-ramp
- [Keymap] spray-mode-map
- [Face] spray-base-face
- [Face] spray-accent-face

** If your emacs color theme does not work well with spray

You could create a function to toggle the emacs theme to one that
works with spray, and then put that in the spray mode hook. For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun toggle-night ()
 (interactive)
  (if (equal (car custom-enabled-themes) 'naquadah)
      (override-theme 'leuven)
  (override-theme 'naquadah)))
(add-hook 'spray-mode-hook 'toggle-night)
#+end_src

Alternatively, one user found ways to setup a single buffer with better colors, using
- http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BufferBackgroundColor
- https://github.com/vic/color-theme-buffer-local

He also found this library useful:

** Feedback, bugs, contributions, all welcome

All on: https://gitlab.com/iankelling/spray

There's lots of features and enhancements to do. The algorithm and interface could certainly be improved in various ways.


** Similar emacs package: speedread

Available in marmalade or [[https://github.com/vapniks/speedread/blob/master/speedread.el][github]] It has several nice features and does
not align on an accent character. Eventually I'd like to merge the two
packages.

** Deficiencies in similar projects which spray.el solves:

The algorithm is inspired from [[https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz][OpenSpritz]].

Mostly as of June 28, 2014.

For all other projects:
- It is very difficult to save your place and come back later. Emacs has
  lots of built in features like bookmarks or just making a note which
  make this easy.
- No keybinds. This is especially useful for common, quickly used
  functionality like pause and back up.

Specific projects:
- [[https://github.com/jbmartinez/speed-readerff][speed-readerff]] firefox extension.
- [[https://github.com/cameron/squirt][squirt]] javascript bookmarklet.
- [[https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz][OpenSpritz]] javascript bookmarklet.
  - Very difficult selecting where to start / what exactly to read.
  - Very difficult to figure out where you are within a document.

- [[https://github.com/chaimpeck/spray][spray]] website you paste text into.
  - Very difficult to figure out where you are within a document.

- [[https://github.com/xypiie/spread0r][spread0r]] Perl program.
  - No apparent way to resize text.
  - Very difficult to figure out where you are within a document.

- [[https://github.com/the-happy-hippo/sprits-it][sprits-it]] website or bookmarklet. Looks most promising of the web based projects.
  - Very difficult selecting where to start / what exactly to read.
  - Somewhat difficult to figure out where you are in a document.

Programs that I, Ian Kelling, didn't try, and why. They also probably have a lot of the problems listed above.
- https://github.com/pasky/speedread No simple way to resize text from default of too small.
- https://github.com/ds300/jetzt Chrome plugin: Chrome is proprietary, and its open source version is unfriendly to linux distros so they don't package it, and it's readme does not list any benefit to this program over others.
- https://github.com/Fr4ncis/openspritz-ios ios program. I don't have an ios device, and this does not appear to have any compelling features.
- https://github.com/OnlyInAmerica/OpenSpritz-Android android program. If I knew how to quickly move reading material to my phone, I would try this out. But, it's readme shows that the program is pretty sparse and would have some of the same problems as listed above, so not worth it.


Downsides compared to similar projects:
- The emacs learning curve.
- Would be hard to get running on a phone.


** Algorithm details

*** Main algorithm code location
In =./spray.el=, the functions =spray--word-at-point=, =spray--update= and =spray-start= contain the main algorithm of choosing a word, an accent character and an interval to display it. Word splitting is also duplicated the same way as in those functions throughout ./spray.el.

*** Algorithm translated from code to english

Words are split at space, tab, newline, and emdash characters.

Each word is displayed for (60 / the choosen wpm) seconds, except if the
word ends with =.!?,;:—= or is greater than 9 characters long, in which
case it is displayed for twice as long.

When started, an added delay is optionally added, based on the
spray-ramp variable. See it's documentation for details.

The accent location is chosen as the nth character in a word, depending
on its length, based on the following table
| length | accent position |
|      1 |               1 |
|    2-5 |               2 |
|    6-9 |               3 |
|  10-13 |               4 |
|    14+ |               5 |
