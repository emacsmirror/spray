;; URL: https://github.com/ian-kelling/spray
;; Mailing list: https://lists.iankelling.org/listinfo/spray
;; Keywords: convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; For speed reading, or just more enjoyable reading. Narrows the buffer to show
;; one word at a time. Adjust speed / pause as needed.
;; 
;; Download from Melpa or put this script into a "load-path"ed directory, and
;; load it in your init file:

;;   (require 'spray)

;; Then you may run spray with "M-x spray-mode". Binding some keys may
;; also be useful.

;;   (global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'spray-mode)

;; In spray-mode buffers, following commands are available.

;; - =spray-start/stop= (SPC) ::
;; pause or resume spraying

;; - =spray-backward-word= (h, <left>) ::
;; pause and back to the last word

;; - =spray-forward-word= (l, <right>) ::
;; inverse of =spray-backward-word=

;; - =spray-faster= (f) ::
;; increases speed

;; - =spray-slower= (s) ::
;; decreases speed

;; - =spray-quit= (q, <return>) ::
;; quit =spray-mode=

;; You may customize spray by modifying following items:

;; - [Variable] spray-wpm
;; - [Variable] spray-height
;; - [Variable] spray-margin-top
;; - [Variable] spray-margin-left
;; - [Variable] spray-ramp
;; - [Keymap] spray-mode-map
;; - [Face] spray-base-face
;; - [Face] spray-accent-face

;; Readme.org from the package repository has some additional information:
;; A gif screencast.
;; Algorithm specification.
;; Comparison with similar projects.

;;; Known bugs:

;; repeated words are indistinguishable, for example
;; "going, going, gone" reads like going, gone, with a slight delay.
;;
;; sentences (like this) should trigger a pause for ( and )

;;; Change Log:

;; 0.0.0 test release
;; 0.0.1 add spray-set-margins
;; 0.0.2 margin options, speed control, better quit

;;; Code:
